The first picoCTF flag I got was for the problem "EVEN RSA CAN BE BROKEN???". This one was very short and consisted of a cyphertext being given. Now since the name of the challenge mentioned RSA I ran the text through an online decoder and voila I had the flag.

The other assignment I completed was the "n0s4n1ty 1". This assignment has us going to a website that was made with the intention of uploading a profile picture. To solve this challenge, the first step was inspecting the element on the page. This lead me to discover that I could inject my own code into the input bar, which I then used to my advantage in Kali. Once there, I would inject code that would display the command I entered. I then was able to find the location of the .txt containing the flag which concluded this challenge.
